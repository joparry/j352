                <p>As a Philadelphia Eagles fan since 2007, I've watched a lot of different people take the helm as the leader of the offense. I've seen the bad times, with Kevin Kolb and Sam Bradford trying to carry a bad team through a tough year. I've also witnessed the good times, like a second year quarterback and a backup quarterback combining to win the <strong>2018 Super Bowl.</strong> </p>
                <p> When you support a team, it can sometimes be easy for you to forget players after they leave. However, I try to always remember those who played well in my team's uniform to respect the services that they provided my team when they played. At the end of the day, these players are just normal people that wear a colored shirt and are expected to carry the weight of a whole fan base of their backs. So I've put together a presentation to pay my respects to various Eagles quarterbacks in recent memory.
