            <p> Recently, states legalizing cannabis has become a hot topic for debate across many parts of the United States. Twenty one states and Washington D.C. have so far legalized recreational cannabis, with the most recent states being Maryland and Missouri in the November 2022 election. </p>
          
            <p>For a lot of these states, legal cannabis licensing, selling, and usage are a very new thing to not just the citizens in the state, but those who are in charge of relegating and enforcing laws surrounding the newfound legality of this culturally significant drug. However, some states have been dealing with legal recreational marijuana for some years now.</p>
              <p> In Oregon, Measure 91 was originally given the go ahead for rulemaking in 2014, and marijuana businesses were able to start applying to become legal on January 1, 2016. It’s a state that has a population of 4.27 million people as of July 1 of this year, according to <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/population-research/population-estimate-reports">Portland State University's Population Research Center</a>. This summer I did some digging on the state of Oregon and how the whole state has been dealing with legalization and seeing what is permissible and what is not in a state with legal recreational “weed.”</p>

              <p> Bryant Haley, a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/olcc/pages/default.aspx">Oregon Liquor & Cannabis Commission</a> (OLCC) is wary of setting a precedent for other states’ and their regulations surrounding cannabis in the future, and he believes that certain rules that protect consumers and keep them safe can be key in making this a reality.</p>
              <p>“I think bringing the industry above board, getting that packaging and labeling on there, and aligning it will set Oregon as an example,” Haley said, “Oregon businesses will look sophisticated and have these products that are safe.”</p>

            <p> Even though cannabis has been legal for some years now in the state, it can only be purchased and sold legally inside of dispensaries throughout Oregon. When looking at the possibility of it being sold in retail stores in the future, Haley believes that it could be a reality, but banks not touching money from cannabis sales has put these businesses at danger of theft due to having to deal with a lot of physical money.</p>
            <p>“We’ve seen people die from being shot and getting robbed, it’s a real problem overall,” Haley remarked, “I would really like to see for the cannabis industry to be able to access financial services, to make transactions safer, and just to allow them not to have just using the burden of cash.”</p>

            <p> A common misconception that people in states that have recently recognized recreational marijuana use may have is just where it can be smoked. Even though the purchasing is legal recreationally if you are older than 21, it is still illegal to use marijuana in public in the state. Smoking in public can result in a citation by law enforcement.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Kevin McQuead, the Chief of Police in Enterprise, Oregon, a town that opted out of Measure 91 when it was passed, he said that enforcing weed smoking laws can be a challenge for his officers to emphasize.</p>
            <p>“It can be hard for us to prioritize marijuana arrests if they aren’t doing any harm, most of the time we ask people to just throw a joint away, because we can’t confiscate it,” McQuead said.</p>

            <p>Another quirk about Measure 91 that was just mentioned was the opt-out method. Counties and then cities were allowed to opt out of Measure 91 for a time after it was passed. Because some counties did opt out, Haley was asked that if a federal legalization of cannabis occurred in the future, would counties across the country in different states be given the same option. He gave an interesting comparison to another heavily regulated substance.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, because there still are counties that can opt out of alcohol throughout the nation,” he said.</p>
            <p>So while it is still up in the air whether all these quirks will soon become a reality in your state, it looks like even states with legalized recreational cannabis still have a long way to go.</p>
