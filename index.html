<h1>A Brief History of 2010's New York Knicks Point Guards</h1>
<h2> A collection of lost potential, injuries, and just bad players</h2>

<img src="images/PG.jpeg" border="0" alt="PGs" title="Our PGs">

<p class="customgraph">I was born in 2002 in New York City, and I went to my first Knicks game at MSG in 2008. It was Knicks vs. Bucks and I watched players like Nate Robinson fly across the court and beat the Bucks (who at that point were far from NBA Champions). Immiediately I fell in love and pledged my fandom to the team. However for the majority of my young adult life several general managers, head coaches, scouts, assistant coaches and a blues playing owner haven't been able to get one position right.

<h3> A position which has recently become the most important on a basketball court.</h3>
<h2> <i>The Point Guard. </i></h2>
<h3> Here are a few of them that I've picked from the last decade that really disappointed the Knick faithful.

<h2><font face=""><font color="orange">1. Brandon Jennings 2016-2017</font></font></h2>

<p><font face="times new roman"></font> A former star with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jennings came to the Knicks after a few stints elsewhere, and was meant to be the backup point guard for Derrick Rose. But when Rose suffered from injuries, the veteran started 13 games for the Knicks. He managed to only average 8.6 points per game and 4.9 assists, while shooting just 38% from the field and 34% from the three point line. Not able to hold onto the starting job through the end of the year, he was waived right after the trade deadline in 2017. The Knicks would go onto win 31 games that season. Jennings is currently out of the league.</p>

<h2><font face=""><font color="orange">2. Jose Calderon 2014-2016</font></font></h2>

<p><font face="times new roman"></font> Calderon arrived in New York at the age of 33 years old in 2014, and ended up starting 42 games in his first season. He averaged a mediocre 9.1 points per game and 4.7 assists per game in 2014-2015, which was supposedly anough to give him the starting job next season. The 2015-2016 season saw him get worse with more playing time, as he averaged 7.6 points per game and 4.1 assists starting 72 games. The Knicks won 32 games, and Jose did not return to the team that next season. Calderon has sinced stop playing, and is currently a special advisor for the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>

<img src="images/Jarrett.jpeg" height="300px" width="500px" align="center" border="1" alt="Jarrett Jack" title="Jarrett Jack">
<h2><font face=""><font color="orange">3. Jarrett Jack 2017-2018</font></font></h2>
<p><font face="times new roman"></font>Jack arrived towards the end of his career as a free agent in New York and was given the starting job the day ebfore his 34th birthday in the fourth game of the season in place of Ramon Sessions. He started 56 games, and his numbers weren't impressive putting up 7.6 points per game to go along with 5.6 assists per game over the 62 game he played. Even though the Knicks were obviously tanking, Jack was still one of the worst starters Knicks fans saw in the 2010's. He hasn't played in the league since that season, and is currently an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns. </p>
