<h1>4. Jeremy Lin 2011-2012 </h1>

<p> If you ask Knicks fans my age what their favorite memory of the team is, a lot of them will refer back to a period of a few months which turned an unknown into a legend. Lin signed as a free agent in December of 2011, and ended up starting 25 games for the team to end the season. In those 25 games, he scored over 20 points per game 10 times, putting up a season high 38 points against the Lakers on February 10th, 2012. When I was a kid, he was my hero for a few months. But after the Knicks went to the playoffs and lost, the Knicks didn't resign him as a free agent. Some credit this to Carmelo Anthony not wanting to share the ball with him, but no one really knows why he wasn't re-signed. Since Lin, the team has not found a good staring point guard, and that was ten years ago. Who knows what the team would've been if he stayed put.</p>
